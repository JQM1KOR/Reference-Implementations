BFSI tabular classification usecase has been considered; where it is demonstrated how AIShield can be used to find vulnerabilities and get the threat-informed defense for both extraction and evasion type of attack. The defense models can then be deployed along with the original model in any cloud ecosystem(here AWS has been used); enabling the malicious users to be blocked at the system level after certain threshold.
